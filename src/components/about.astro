      I am <strong>Alan Turing</strong>, <em>a mathematician, computer scientist, and logician</em>. I am
      the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. I
      invented the Turing machine, which is a model of a general-purpose computer.
      I am also known for my work on breaking the Enigma code during World War II.

      In short, I am a scientist who is passionate about using mathematics and
      logic to solve problems and create new things. I believe that computers have
      the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work, and I am committed
      to developing the theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence.
